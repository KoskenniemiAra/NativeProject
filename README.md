# NativeProject

All the basic view composables, navigation and firebase authentication and firestore are done
Don't have the APK because there isn't one in the app/build/outputs directory for some reason, probably missed some step necessary for it.


If you somehow can connect to my firebase auth a working user is test@test.com with pw: testing. 
If you can't setting loggedIn as true in LoginViewModel will allow access to app.
